# Contributing to FOSScanner

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a small, privacy-first FOSS
project — issues and PRs of any size are welcome.

## Development setup

See the README's "Getting started" section for running the app. Skim the
code comments for the reasoning behind a few non-obvious decisions before
making non-trivial changes.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Docker is also available if you don't want the Flutter/Android SDKs
installed locally — see the README's "Running with Docker" section.

## Commit messages: Conventional Commits

This repo's versioning and `CHANGELOG.md` are generated automatically by
[Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from commit
messages on `main`, following [Conventional
Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Please prefix commits (or
at minimum, squash-merged PR titles) accordingly:

| Prefix | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fix: ...` | Patch release (bug fixes) |
| `feat: ...` | Minor release (new features) |
| `feat!: ...` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | Major release |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `ci:` | No version bump, but recorded |

A commit that doesn't follow this format still merges fine — it just won't
show up correctly in the next automated changelog entry.

Commits should be attributed to their actual human author. Please don't
add `Co-Authored-By` trailers for AI coding assistants.

## Pull requests

- Base your branch on `dev` and open pull requests against `dev`, not
  `main`. `main` only advances when `dev` is deliberately promoted for a
  release — PRs opened against it directly won't be merged there.
- Keep PRs focused — one logical change per PR is easier to review and
  keeps `git bisect` useful.
- CI (`flutter analyze` + `flutter test`) must pass before merge.
- For anything touching `document_processor_native.dart` or the OpenCV
  bindings, please test on a real device or emulator — `flutter_test`'s
  fake-time test binding doesn't reliably exercise the native image
  pipeline.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Use the issue templates — they ask whether the problem occurs on Android,
iOS, web, Linux, macOS, or Windows, plus the Flutter version. That platform
report is usually the first thing needed to reproduce an issue in this
codebase given how much behavior is platform-specific.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for how to report a vulnerability privately
instead of opening a public issue.
